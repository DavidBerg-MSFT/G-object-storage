== API Specific Runtime Parameters ==
* api_region       GCS supports global and regional containers. Global 
                   containers have greater distribution and support higher
                   availability. Global container options: EU, US
                   Regional containers allow for data to explicitly be stored
                   in the same data centers as Google Compute Engine. 
                   Containers of this type always use the 
                   DURABLE_REDUCED_AVAILABILITY storage class and have a lower 
                   availability SLA. Regional container options: us-east1, 
                   us-east2, us-east3, us-central1, us-central2, us-west1. 
                   Current documentation is available here:
                   https://developers.google.com/storage/docs/concepts-techniques#specifyinglocations
                   Default is US
* encryption       GCS implicitly uses encryption - there is no option to 
                   enable or disable this
* storage_class    [STANDARD | DURABLE_REDUCED_AVAILABILITY] Desired S3 storage 
                   class. Default is STANDARD for global containers and always 
                   DURABLE_REDUCED_AVAILABILITY (DRA) for regional containers 
                   (regional containers must be DRA). Default is STANDARD
