== API Specific Runtime Parameters ==
* api_region       S3 maintains a 1 to 1 relationship to EC2 compute regions.
                   Current regions supported include:

* dns_containers   [1|0] Whether to reference S3 buckets using DNS (e.g. 
                   https://mybucket.s3.amazonaws.com) or URI based methods 
                   (e.g. https://s3.amazonaws.com/mybucket). Default is 1
* encryption       [AES256] Set this parameter to 'AES256' to utilize S3's 
                   server-side encryption
* storage_class    [STANDARD | REDUCED_REDUNDANCY] Desired S3 storage class.
                   Default is STANDARD
