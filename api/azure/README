Implements Windows Azure Storage API compatibility. This implementation uses
the Azure Block Blob REST API. This API supports a maximum of 64MB for a single
upload, and a maximum of 4MB for multipart upload operations. Objects larger 
than 64MB must be uploaded using multipart.

== Feature Support ==
# Multiple Regions                   PARTIAL (see below)
# DNS Containers                     NO
# Download Concurrency (Byte Range)  YES
# Upload Concurrency (Multipart)     YES (required for objects > 4MB)
# Min Multipart Segment Size         None
# Max Multipart Segment Size         4MB
# Max Upload Operation Size          64MB
# Encryption                         NO
# Multiple Storage Classes           PARTIAL (see below)


== API Specific Runtime Parameters ==
* api_region       Azure supports multiple regions - but the region is 
                   designated at the time of account creation and cannot be 
                   modified through the storage API. Thus, while this
                   parameter may be specified for reporting purposed, it will 
                   not change the actual location used derived by the account 
                   configuration. Current Azure storage regions include:
                   us-east, us-northcentral, us-southcentral, us-west, eu-west,
                   eu-north, asia-east, asia-southeast
* storage_class    Azure supports both locally redundant and geo redundant 
                   storage classes. The latter replicates data to a secondary 
                   region and provides higher availability. However, this also 
                   is an account setting that modified using the storage API. 
                   Azure storage classes are: grs (geo redundant storage) and 
                   lrs (locally redundant storage)
